		<p>Nolan shot Interstellar on 35 mm film in the Panavision anamorphic format and IMAX 70 mm photography.[30] Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema was hired for Interstellar, as Wally Pfister, Nolan's cinematographer on all of his previous films, was making his directorial debut working on Transcendence (2014).[31] More IMAX cameras were used for Interstellar than for any of Nolan's previous films. To minimize the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI), the director had practical locations built, such as the interior of a space shuttle.[25] Van Hoytema retooled an IMAX camera to be hand-held for shooting interior scenes.[7] Some of the film's sequences were shot with an IMAX camera installed in the nose cone of a Learjet.[32]</p>
